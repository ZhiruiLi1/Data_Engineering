What if the URL contained ‘.cam’ instead of ‘.com’ but otherwise corresponded with a URL in the ‘products’ table? In that case the proper approach would be to correct the URL. In other cases, the URL might be so corrupted that the best approach would be to delete that log entry (the entire row). Describe your approach to dealing with corrupted URLs. That is, describe your approach to determining that a URL is too corrupted to be rescued. It must describe a) a procedure for determining the degree to which the URL is corrupted, b) a threshold for determining in terms of this degree of corruption whether it can be corrected, and c) for those which can be corrected, identifying its corrected form.

    "The way I use to evaluate how corrupted the URL is is using a function called SequenceMatcher from difflib package. This function calculates a similarity score between two URLs (a corrupted one and a correct one) and if the score passes a threshold, then these two URLs are considered similar (the corrupted URL is not too corrupted). When the threshold is 0.95, there are three URLs don't pass the threshold and are considered too corrupted. The indices of them are 790, 5876, and 7263. Actually, we can see that those URLs are not too corrupted; they are only off by one letter, so I decide to decrease the threshold to 0.9. "

    "When making recommendations regarding ads for such and such product are most likely to produce clicks in such and sentiment context, ads for such and such product are most likely to produce clicks in such and sentiment context by viewers of such and such gender, and ads for such and such product are most likely to produce clicks in such and sentiment context by viewers of such and such age-group, we assume that the analysis of click rate regarding product type can be direcyly apply to individual product. Moreover, if there are multiple products in that product type, we randomly choose one from them. In order to make my methodology scalable, I use python script instead of SQL query to calculate different kinds of click rates. Then, I create tables in the database, making sure all primary keys and foreign key constraints are correct. One main limitation I have within the study is that when choosing the threshold to determine whether each row (in task 11 and 12) is significant, I don't perform any statistical testing. I choose the threshold based on histogram of the correlation column. If one wants to be rigorous, they need to perform statistical testings to determine if the record is significant. Moreover, in the log file, I only have 10000 rows of data for 50 products, can potentially gather more information to conduct a more rigorous analysis. Lastly, the whole study doesn’t consider interaction effects when making recommendations, in the future, one should measure how gender and age group together affect the click rate for different products based on different sentiments. \n"
